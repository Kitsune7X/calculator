Calculator App written in JavaScript.

## Overview

- It was quite rough at first trying to get all the functions work seamlessly. So many things to consider but I finally got them working. The app should behave like how a normal Calculator should.
- Full Keyboard support with the following mapping:

  > > - **Numbers**: Number keys.
  > > - **Equal**: Enter.
  > > - **Clear All**: Escape.
  > > - **Clear One by One**: Backspace.
  > > - **Audio Switch**: Control.

- Mobile support.
- **Logo** and **Image** were make in Clip Studio Paint and Photoshop.
